# RNA-seq snakemake pipeline

This folder contains subfolders for different versions of RNA-seq snakemake pipelines. Each subfolder should a README.md file with instructions for use.

At the moment, we have one version of the pipeline: the standard pipeline. This pipeline is designed for RNA-seq analysis of repetitive element expression which produces two final count tables for all samples containing gene + subfamily raw counts and and gene + locus-specific raw counts, respectively.
